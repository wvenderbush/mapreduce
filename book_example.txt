THE BOOK OF WAR




INTRODUCTION


I

Written in the fifth century B.C., Suntzu and Wutzu still remain the
most celebrated works on war in the literature of China. While the
chariot has gone, and weapons have changed, these ancient masters have
held their own, since they deal chiefly with the fundamental principles
of war, with the influence of politics and human nature on military
operations; and they show in a most striking way how unchanging these
principles are.

When these books were written, China was a conglomerate of
principalities in continual ferment. Personal ambition and intrigue,
and not the wishes of the people, were the main factors in these wars.
Patriotism, or a popular cause, could not, therefore, be relied on
to maintain the _moral_ of the levies. Instead of these, what may be
called the force of despair is pointed out as the most powerful agent
in giving cohesion and energy to an army. The general is urged to
take a vigorous offensive; and to act at a distance from his base,
where defeat means disaster, and where desertion is minimised owing to
the distance from home. He should, in fact, burn his boats before an
action, or, in Chinese phrase, act as one who removes the ladder from
under those mounted upon the roof.

On the other hand, every care must be taken not to render the enemy
desperate; and, as an instance of this, Sun observes that an opponent
should on no account be completely surrounded. A loop-hole of escape
weakens the resolution of the general and the energy of his troops.
